## Hi, I'm Vipul 👋

I'm a backend-heavy software engineer who enjoys designing **flexible, scalable systems** and understanding **how abstractions work under the hood**.

I care about:
- clean architecture and separation of concerns  
- extensibility over hard-coded logic  
- building systems that evolve without constant rewrites  
- understanding *why* a design exists, not just *how* to use it  

---

### 🔬 What I Work On

- **Backend Systems** — extensible APIs, query modeling, clean boundaries
- **Architecture & Design** — design patterns, trade-offs, long-term maintainability
- **Problem Solving** — data structures, system thinking, edge-case driven design
- **Frontend (supporting skill)** — React, performance-aware UI systems

---

### 🧠 Featured Project

#### 🔹 Dynamic Query Engine
A **generic, extensible query engine** that dynamically builds queries based on metadata rather than hard-coded conditions.

It focuses on:
- decoupling query logic from business code  
- supporting complex filtering without if-else explosions  
- enabling safe extensibility through structured metadata  
- reducing long-term maintenance cost in evolving systems  

> Designed to solve real-world backend problems where query requirements grow faster than codebases.

### 🧪 Additional Work

- **react-patterns-lab** — a monorepo of advanced React and browser pattern explorations, focused on performance, accessibility, and trade-offs
- **Design Patterns Study** — practical implementations of common patterns with real use cases

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java, REST APIs, Spring (familiar), SQL
- **Architecture:** Design Patterns, Clean Code, SOLID
- **Frontend:** React, modern hooks, performance optimization
- **Core CS:** Data Structures, System Design

### 📌 Philosophy

> “Good systems grow from clear boundaries, not clever code.”

I use GitHub to:
- capture architectural ideas as working code  
- maintain reusable reference implementations  
- explore designs that scale beyond initial requirements

📫 Always open to discussions around system design, backend architecture, and engineering trade-offs.
